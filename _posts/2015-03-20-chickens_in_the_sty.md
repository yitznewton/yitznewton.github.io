In [a recent blog post](http://www.mattblodgett.com/2015/03/should-managers-share-update-in-standup.html), [Matt Blodgett](https://twitter.com/mattblodgett) addressed the issue of managers giving updates in the Daily Scrum.

If I understand his conclusion correctly, he sees the Daily as an opportunity to encourage mutual accountability of the team. As such, folks who are not actively, daily involved with activities that are moving the team forward don't belong. If they are looking for status, then artifacts are an appropriate source for this.

Ultimately though, the question goes beyond managers: *any* stakeholder could have pertinent information that they might communicate at the daily meeting. So should they?

## Why do we hold a Daily Scrum?

If the agile approach is about accomodating change, then to me, the Daily Scrum is a checkpoint for detecting and anticipating change. Scrum is an *empirical* process, where we execute, and use the experience to execute better the next round. Each day, we get together and share our experience of how things went, whether they were what we thought they would be, whether our predictions still look accurate and our commitments attainable. If something changes, like our understanding of the problem, a market force, or the availability of a vendor data service, the Daily is the team's opportunity to share the knowledge and adapt together.

## Do non-team-members fit into that model?

As such, if someone from outside the team has new information that might impact the direction of the team, then it *might* be appropriate for them to deliver it in the Daily. However, if it's related to the business of the product, it ought to come from the Product Owner. It is *they* who have the authority to act on that information. They should be the first team member to know about it, and should be the voice of other product stakeholders to the team on a day-to-day basis.

If a non-member has information impacting the team and which is not directly related to the product, then the Daily Scrum seems like the right place to share it.
