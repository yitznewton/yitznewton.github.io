<p>I LOLed when this tweet hit my feed:</p>

    Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/GeekGirlCon">@GeekGirlCon</a>, can you RT? I know a 13yo girl who wants to be game dev but has run into wall learning. Needs advice/mentor. Anyone help?

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> I don't really know much at all about game dev, so I can't help there, but I was tickled, because one the similarity to one of my first coding projects of any size.</p>

<p>As a kid, my father was a college professor, so he geeked around with the office Apple ][, including those books they used to sell containing the source code for simple games. So you sit and enter the code into the line editor line. By. Line. By. Dagnabbit re-enter that Line. By Line. and play the game.</p>

<p>I was not a detailed-oriented lad, so I was hard-pressed to enter 500 lines of code correctly; alas the games rarely ran. But anyway, from there it was on to QBasic. After <a href="http://www.amazon.com/QBasic-By-Example-Special-Edition/dp/1565294394">learning me some QB</a> I decided on a project: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattergories">Scattergories</a>! I started working on a QBasic version. I implemented (I think) a filesystem store for the categories, and did some ghetto ASCII BASIC graphics, accepted user names and input, etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately my software design skills and general coding toolset were quite limited. IIRC QBasic offered a regular blocking input, which is what I tried using for receiving answers. This of course prevented the timer from cutting the player off until they actually answered the question. I was aware of a key-based entry mechanism, but I was too lazy to implement it. Anyway I don't think I had been exposed to the concept of a main loop, and yada yada; I just wasn't quite ready for a project of that scale.</p>

<p>When I saw the tweet, I started thinking about how awesome some of the young coders are out there, in contrast to myself at that age, and I wondered about pathways that young folks (or anyone) might take in learning software. Abstract thinking skills are probably one of the most important points, so a good grounding in basic algebra. As I librarian I worked a lot with messy human-generated data, and being forced to manipulate and work with it got me used to handling data in various formats. I played me some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky's_Boots">Rocky's Boots</a> (a basic electronic logic toolkit for kids) back in the day, so that got me thinking about logic paths.</p>

<p>But really the bottom line for me was, get motivated by finding problems to solve. I'm a huge slacker until I find something really engaging, at which point I become an insane ninja (see also <a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/INTP.html">INTP</a>). I cooked up some WordBasic macros to automate homework creation. Annoying repetitive tasks as a librarian prodded me into writing my first real-world professional-life code, which is what really launched me into development for real.</p>

<p>So: find an itch that you want to scratch, and do it in code.</p>
