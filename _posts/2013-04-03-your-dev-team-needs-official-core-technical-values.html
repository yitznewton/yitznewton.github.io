<p>I've been thinking a lot lately about cohesion of dev teams, looking at MPOW
in particular. Pondering the things that are important to me (clear process,
TDD) made me realize: the dev team isn't really a team without some sort of
shared culture.</p>

<p></p>What was less obvious to me was, this ought to manifest
itself concretely. Until now I was thinking of that in terms of policy, but it
struck me this morning: the values that the team adheres to collectively should
be explicit. What's important to us? Do we most value stability? Innovation?
Agility? Clarity of code? As I realized in reading Code Complete recently,
there are different ways of measuring "quality;" so too there are different
general technical values, and the mission of a dev team (and the predilections
of its members) will inform what those values are.</p>

<p>One thing that we're
lacking in my team is <i>technical leadership.</i>Â Aside from <i>management,
</i>a team needs folks who are in touch with all their constituent devs, speak
their language, and nurture the culture that defines core tech values. Without
that leadership and cohesion, it's just a bunch of people working toward a
shared goal, not really a team.</p>
