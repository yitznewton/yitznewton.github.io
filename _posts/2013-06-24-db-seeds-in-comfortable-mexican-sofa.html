<p>I just found a most awesome Rails CMS called Comfortable Mexican Sofa. The name is annoyingly long, but it's exactly what I was looking for: a light CMS for Rails with an extensible admin UI that can be fitted on existing models. I want to write up my discovery, but in the meantime, here's the resolution of an initial roadblock I ran into.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>I have one of my standard AR models tied into Sofa's site and category taxonomies. I spent a couple of hours banging my head against trying to write database seeds for these relationships. In the end, it was just a matter of reverse-engineering the Sofa is_categorized models. Here's my seed file, Sponsorship being my custom model.</p>

<pre><code>pti_site = Cms::Site.create!(
  identifier: "yeshiva-pti",
  label: "Yeshiva PTI",
  hostname: "localhost",
  path: "",
  locale: "en",
  is_mirrored: false,
)

standard_sponsorship_category = 
  pti_site.categories.create!(
    label: "Standard",
    categorized_type: "Sponsorship",
  )

sponsorships = Sponsorship.create!([
  {
    name: "Week of Learning",
    amount: 1000,
  },
  {
    name: "Three Days of Learning",
    amount: 720,
  },
  {
    name: "One Day of Learning",
    amount: 360,
  },
  {
    name: "One Night Seder",
    amount: 120,
  },
])

sponsorships.each do |sponsorship|
  standard_sponsorship_category.categorizations.create!(
    categorized: sponsorship
  )
end
</code></pre>
