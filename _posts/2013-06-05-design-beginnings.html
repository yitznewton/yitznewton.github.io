<p>Throughout my life, I've always liked to have a bunch of random (and not so random) projects going on in the background of my mainline life activities. So in high school, there was translating *The Hobbit *and doing layout for the French literary magazine. In college, there was planning and arranging for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Friday-Night-Organ-Pump/128240730525534">Friday Night Organ Pump</a>, and another newspaper layout job. Oh, and learning Judaism. Lately I've realized that my project life has languished, so I've been on the lookout for new opportunities.</p>

<p>I'm really interested in tech cofoundering (hmm...) or first-tech-lead role in a startup in an area I value, such as education or SMB support. But, not having found that yet, I'm starting to look at freelance web. I'm loath to do standard-issue display sites, but I actually discovered that my own synagogue is looking to redo its hodge-podge site. They have a heavy emphasis (primary even) on continuing education, so there's a lot more potential than just a brochure-type site.</p>

<p>As such, I've started cracking into design. I bought Principles of Beautiful Web Design a while back, and now Design for Hackers. There's more exploration of certain historical topics in D4H than I would have asked for, but I really like Kadavy's presentation of design fundamentals of composition and proportion. These are slightly intuitive for me, but they're way out of my professional experience; I felt like he made them much more accessible in their depth, without diluting the concepts. His treatment of color was thorough also; this is a problem area for me, since my red-green colorblindness can leave me vulnerable to eyeburning combinations.</p>

<p>Anyway, the point of all this was, in approaching the synagogue site, I realized that they need a new logo, and in exploring that, found myself in an Apple Store experimenting with Paper for iPad. Again. It's really quite a masterpiece of UX, balancing functionality with approachability. In the five minutes I played with it, I was able to produce sketches of three concepts I've been working up in my head and physical sketchbook this week. As Travis explains in <a href="http://www.uxventure.com/paper-vs-sketchbook-pro-a-study-in-design-constraint/">his review of the app</a>, Paper's developers really achieved a remarkably poised balance in creating a UI for a really tricky product.</p>

<p>So I went and ordered me a refurb iPad Mini! It's been a decision a while in the making, but this clinched it. My first Apple product since I sold my iPhone 3GS a year or so ago. And now I get to play Impossible Road and Nightjar XD</p>
