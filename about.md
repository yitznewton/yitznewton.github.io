I'm Yitzchak Schaffer; I do software in New York City and Northern New
Jersey.  I started out in education because of the tremendous potential to
help people gain knowledge and core skills. After finding software development
and falling in love with it, I have sought out the best opportunities to build
wonderful products, and grow as an individual and a developer.

In addition to product development, I love working with rich datasets. I
strongly favor Extreme Programming; my developer heart found its home with
Uncle Bob Martin's methodology of Agile development and clean code. Iâ€™m
especially at home in the education and B2B spaces because of their high
intrinsic value.
