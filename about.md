I'm Yitzchak Schaffer; I do software in New York City and Northern New
Jersey.  I started out in education because of the tremendous potential to
help people gain knowledge and core skills. After finding software development
and falling in love with it, I have sought out the best opportunities to build
wonderful products, and grow as an individual and a developer.

In addition to product development, I love working with rich datasets. I
strongly favor
[Extreme Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658);
my developer heart was stolen by
Uncle Bob Martin's
[methodology of Agile development](http://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445)
and
[clean](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
[code](https://cleancoders.com/).
Iâ€™m
especially at home in the education and B2B spaces because of their high
intrinsic value.
