Here are the books that have made the biggest impact on my career.

## Software design and makery

These books generally include some material on process, but are focused on the semantics and mechanics of how to design and create software.

* [Clean Code. Robert C. "Uncle Bob" Martin](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882). A modern classic of OOP practice.
* [Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices (a.k.a. the "PPP" book). Uncle Bob](http://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445). Written before *Clean Code,* but follows it conceptually. A masterwork of XP-fueled object-oriented design. The newer C# version is available as a Kindle book and is equivalent in content.
* [Extreme Programming Explained. Kent Beck](http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Edition/dp/0321278658). Some of the presentation is a bit floaty, but practicality increases as the book goes on, and it's a seminal Agile Software book.

## Team building

* [Notes to a Software Team Leader. Roy Osherove](https://leanpub.com/teamleader). A book of sketches based on Roy's experiences coaching dev teams.

## Coming up

Some classics in my to-read list that I expect will be added once I finish them:

* [Team Geek. Fitzpatrick and Collins-Sussman](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018025.do)
* [Peopleware. DeMarco and Lister](http://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Second-Edition/dp/0932633439)
* [The Art of Agile Development. James Shore](http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/). Based on XP.
* [User Stories Applied. Mike Cohn](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/books/user-stories-applied)
