I started out in education because of the tremendous potential to help people gain knowledge and core skills. After finding software development and falling in love with it, I have sought the best opportunities to build wonderful products, and grow as a human and a builder of software. Given my commitment to my family, I want to work in the New York metro area.

I'm looking to join a team of mature professionals in a role that will challenge me with technical leadership responsibility. I value communication, humility, and feedback. Extreme Programming and Uncle Bob Martin's principles and techniques are the basis for my approach to software development. In addition to product development, I love working with rich datasets.
