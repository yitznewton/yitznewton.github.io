Hi, I'm Yitz Schaffer. I've been making software since 2008 (about 7 years). I'm [an INTP](http://www.personalitypage.com/INTP.html) and I love discovering new ways to understand people, like personality typology.

I worked at the [Touro College Libraries](http://www.tourolib.org/) for 9 years, first as a librarian, then as a software developer. I was with [Vitals.com](http://www.vitals.com/) for a year an a half, and I have been with [Imagine Easy Solutions](http://www.imagineeasy.com/) for a year now.

Here is what's important to me.

## Autonomy

I've been fortunate: since I was a child, the people I've worked with have **empowered me with trust and responsibility** to do awesome things. When I ran a Staples Copy Center, my managers gave me the latitude to make changes that **made the center work better for customers, and made the team happy.**

As a technical librarian turned developer, my teammates at the Touro College Libraries recognized the **amazing ways I was able to empower the library using software**, and allowed me to devote lots of time to honing those skills. As a result, we delivered products that enhanced the prestige of the library within the College and the greater community, and which they continue to use throughout every day, years later.

## Community and Leadership

**Humility, respect, and trust.** It's a little cliché, but Team Geek got this right. Add **communication and feedback**, and you have the raw materials of a functioning team.

For the last two years I've been in roles which required me to guide other developers. I am ready to lead a team of 2-5 dedicated people. Motivational skills are not my forte; I do better **leading enthusiastic people by example and encouragement**, empowering my team to meet and stretch their personal best.

I've given several **workshops in TDD and Git techniques.**

## Product

I gravitate toward products with **deep human value**; my career so far has been focused on education and consumer health tools. This is important to me, but I also acknowledge that as a software professional, the craft of making software has a significance of its own, and I want to learn from masters. I love **working with rich data.** I'm open to joining any sort of team, be it a team building its own product, or a consulting group.

## TDD

I use Test-Driven Development, and want to work with others who also have a **strong practice of TDD.**

## Pair Programming

I've been experimenting with pairing for about two years, and it continues to grow on me. I'm not at the point where I know I would be comfortable pairing all day, but I definitely want to continue **increasing my pairing practice.**

## Colocation

My ideal is to have the **whole team sitting together in the same space**, including the product owner. I've also worked successfully in distributed scenarios, when I was at Touro, and also during Hurricane Sandy, when the Vitals office was closed for about a week.

## Other XP stuff

I am a pretty **ardent Uncle Bob-ist.** I love his books and videos; his principles and techniques form the backbone of the way I approach software. I'd love to join others who share this perspective, or possibly a team led by an expert who has 15+ years of experience, and has gotten to the point where they can start developing a comprehensive approach of their own.

## Technologies

Most of my work has been in PHP and Ruby. I've used Symfony/Silex, Rails 4, some Laravel, and a little Sinatra. I pick up what I need to get things done. I like working with Java, and my favorite language for thinking about programming is Haskell.

When I was at Vitals, I did a lot of work with our PostgreSQL servers in terms of tuning some relatively large joins (60M rows with indexes composed of five columns) and weekly bulk update operations. I've managed Linux servers using Puppet; mostly locally-hosted, but a bit of AWS as well.
